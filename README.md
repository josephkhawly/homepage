# homepage
This is a replacement for the default startpage in Chrome and Firefox. Feel free to clone or fork it and adjust it to your liking by adding/removing links and changing the background, fonts and colors.

This can also be found in the homepage folder of [my website's repo](https://github.com/josephkhawly/personal-site).

The text at the top will change depending on the time of day.

Check out a live demo [here](http://josephkhawly.com/homepage).

Inside the new_style branch is a completely new terminal-style homepage based on [this](https://github.com/xprmt/xprmt.github.io).
